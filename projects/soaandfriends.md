Chrystelle commissioned me to create artwork for Influences ‚Äî her 4-song EP with a vintage groovy jazz style. The brief was simple ‚Äî the artwork should include a photo of Chrystelle and feel modern and playful with a warm, slightly-retro vibe. Smooth rounded shapes immediately came to mind. The deliverables included a square album cover as well as a banner design for promotional applications.

This was my first time designing an album cover and I was really happy with how it turned out. Thankfully so was Chrystelle üòÖ

<blockquote>‚ÄúMy Dear Fiona, I really have to say it again: GREAT work, well-executed, very nice creative interpretation of the brief. I really, really enjoyed the smooth and incredibly fast turnaround. Thank you!!‚Äù
