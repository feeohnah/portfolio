Digital Moment, a Canadian non-profit established in 2013, is dedicated to enhancing digital literacy among youth and educators. They wanted to revitalize and restructure their content, alongside updating their website to more effectively showcase their impact and streamline user access to essential resources. The organization sought a design that not only embraced their signature bright yellow and blue colors but also featured a flexible, modular architecture to facilitate future expansions.

This project was a joint endeavor with Growth Gardener (Shannon Craig), who played a pivotal role in content revision, organization, and client communications. Drawing from Shannonâ€™s comprehensive outline, I developed a series of modular sections tailored to optimally present the different content types, adding simple playful animations where necessary.

Digital Moment now has an outward online appearance that reflects their outstanding work.
