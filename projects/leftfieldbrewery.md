Mark and Mandy Murphy approach Matt and I in 2013 to flesh out their branding, create product labels for their very first 3 beers and design and build a website. Over the years we designed more labels and created a custom Shopify store so they could start selling beer online — they were one of the first Breweries in Toronto to do so. We’re so happy to see how much Left Field has grown since then — enough to hire their own in-house designer — and we’re grateful to have been a part of their success story.
