A “pandemic-project”, my partner Matt and I started Pawzzles in 2020 as a fun way to repurpose material that would otherwise have gone to waste — wood veneer offcuts from our other business, Fondfolio where we make collaborative memory books.

Sometimes your cat wants attention when you have a meeting, or are otherwise unavailable. In these cases, a Pawzzle is a great way to focus that energy and engage their natural hunting instincts — it’s like a frustration reduction box!

This is in no way a money-making venture — we donate 10% of each sale to animal welfare initiatives and give to a combination of local cat-based charities, such as the Toronto Cat Rescue (where we adopted our cat Minou), and the Effective Altruism Animal Welfare Fund.
