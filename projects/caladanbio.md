Caladan Bio is a biotech start-up aiming to streamline synthetic biology. They wanted a strong but friendly visual identity that communicated growth, flow, openness, support and scientific precision. Inspired by the process of cell-division I created a geometric logomark that can combine with copies of itself to form new molecules (supporting graphics). I paired this with a geometric sans-serif typeface for the wordmark that is angular, but affable. To gently contrast the precision of the brand I created a stop-motion animation with a more organic feel that speaks to the live cultures that will grow in Caladan’s reactors.
