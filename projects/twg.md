One of my favourite tasks as a designer on the Marketing Team at TWG was creating collateral for internal events. I had complete creative freedom and it was rewarding to witness my co-workers react to the work — so often as a designer you don’t get to see people enjoying the things you make.

<p class="caption">Swag I designed for the annual company retreat to Camp Winnebagoe. The theme for 2019 was wild plants of Ontario so each cabin was assigned a deadly native plant. Everyone received a poison ivy pin, a custom embroidered badge of their cabin’s toxic species as well as a passport containing a map, event information and some tips on how to stay warm.</p>
