Eli’s Place wanted to bring more consistency to their online presence while maintaining a bright, energetic and nurturing feel. This work included creating a UI library of reusable components — from buttons and icons to page sections — for their website and promotional materials. Where necessary, I also provided guidance on copywriting and content.
