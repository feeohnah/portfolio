When my friend Tyler turned 30, my partner Matt and I helped his wife collect words from all his friends and family and together we made a book. We expected it would be fun, but didn’t anticipate the delight it generated, not just for Tyler, but for everyone involved. This joyful experience was the inspiration for [Fondfolio](https://fondfolio.com/). Since our launch in 2015 our mission has been to facilitate meaningful gift giving for special moments and relationships.

Fondfolio is a self-funded venture between myself and my partner [Matt](https://iammatt.ca/). He does most of the web development work and is deeply involved with the design as well as every little thing that I need a second opinion on. This project would not exist without his efforts.
