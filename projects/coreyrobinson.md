After earning his PhD in Political Science, Corey was looking to upgrade his personal identity online which included an updated website. The goals were to highlight his publication work and include subtle visual nods to his research focus of migration. As the sole designer on the project, I lead the creative from start to finish — concept development, visual design and handoff for development.
